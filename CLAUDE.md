# CLAUDE.md — session handoff / context-save

Read this first in any new chat so we resume perfectly. Keep it updated as the
project moves.

## Repo
- **Name:** Track-2-3-mint-agent (GitHub: `vangaalg/track-2-3-mint-agent`)
- **What it is:** **Track 2** of a self-improving options-trading agent — the
  **chart-layer breadth test only**. NOT the live trading journal, NOT the
  execution engine. Full framing lives in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md); read it
  before doing anything substantive.

## Branch / git
- **Active dev branch:** `claude/dazzling-lamport-7d0je8` — develop, commit, and
  push here. Do **NOT** push to `main` without explicit permission.
- Push with `git push -u origin claude/dazzling-lamport-7d0je8`.
- **Do NOT open a pull request** unless explicitly asked.

## What this repo does (one line)
Score the chart stack's single `long / short / flat` call across many
instruments on stored historical OHLCV, in batch, to find where the edge
generalizes. Three stages: (1) directional read → (2) levels → (3) combined
ruleset. Stage 1 is the cheap wide filter and is what's wired up first.

## Current layout
```
data/         OHLCV pulls per instrument (gitignored)
indicators/   engine.py (EMA/BB/RSI/MACD/3-min), directional.py (resolver),
              DIRECTIONAL_SPEC.md (the spec)
scoring/      stage1.py (directional-read scoring stub)
results/      score tables / reports
config.example.yaml   copy to config.yaml (gitignored) and edit
```

## Key design constraint — never violate
The single `long / short / flat` resolver is **not hardcoded**. It is a config
switch between **confluence voting** (N-of-M agree else flat) and
**hierarchical** (one primary decides, others filter/veto), kept flexible
enough to express *hierarchical-with-confluence-confirmation*. The whole point
is to let Stage 1 backtesting decide which wins **per instrument**. See
`indicators/DIRECTIONAL_SPEC.md`.

## Special instructions / working agreements
- This repo = **implementation only**. Strategy/judgment calls
  (confluence-vs-hierarchical results, "real edge or curve-fitting", road-path)
  go to a **separate strategy chat**, not here.
- **Reuse** existing code where it exists — esp. `breeze_pull.py` for Breeze
  pulls. Don't rebuild from scratch.
- Chart layer ONLY. OI/options and geopolitical/macro layers are **excluded**
  from Track 2.
- Data sources: **Breeze** (Indian), **Twelve Data** (global, primary).
  Indicators computed locally so the same code runs everywhere.
- SMA-200 needs ~400-day rolling window per symbol.

## Status / next steps
- [x] Phase-1 skeleton: dirs, indicator engine (math implemented), directional
      resolver (both methods), Stage-1 scoring stub.
- [ ] Wire a real data loader (`breeze_pull.py` reuse + Twelve Data adapter).
- [ ] Fill 3-min strategy component logic from the journal rules (Phase 2).
- [ ] Implement Stage-1 scoring loop + instrument × expectancy table output.
